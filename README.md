# Live_Emoji
Welcome to the Live Emoji project! This project demonstrates how to classify different human emotions using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras. The system leverages real-time webcam input to predict and display emotions in live video feed, using MediaPipe's Holistic model for face and hand landmark detection.
